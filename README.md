Image shows that most of the trips have a 5 minutes duration wich says that must of the people using the program for short trips and uses it as a transportation and not of exercise.

As we can see bikes are mostly used for work trips since work days are more popular and peak hours are begining or end of office hours.

### Are men or women more interested?

As we can see, most of the subscribers are men who use this program on weekdays during check in or check out time.

## Summary

- As we could see, this program has been successful among the male audience during working hours, so we can conclude that we have a well-defined "target" audience, however, there are many ways to allocate marketing strategies to attract more female audiences, perhaps to different hours or holidays and weekends.
- A very interesting point of this analysis is that the season of use is very defined, which can be considered an area of an opportunity area to improve the logistics strategies for placing bicycles.
-  Bellow you can find my additional visualizations suggestions:
   * Female check in and check out, so marketing strategies can improve to attract this public.
   * To show routes can be helpful so logistics strategies can improve and grow actual users number. 
   * Peak seasons per Year could be helpful to check the big picture and improve strategies to grow actual subscribers number.
